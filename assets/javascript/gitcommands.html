I give you an array of 51 cards. Each card contains two properties: the suite, and the title (a string of either a number or a ranking: king, ace, so on).

Fifty-two cards form a deck. But I gave you 51. One is missing! How do you find it?

Try to come up with the most efficient steps to solve this.

Hint: Using a for loop against an array of values is not the most efficient solution--what if the cards aren't sorted?

empty arrays for each suit
for loop with split() to separate each pile
push suits 
each pile contains 13 cards
